## Description

This is my first ever Solidity smart contract, please don't be too picky on the data structure and the code, I still need to learn the best practices and this was a complete discovery.

I went with a simple CRUD data structure and the same contract owns the data, there's no proxy to a data store only contract.

To develop the contract itself I went with TDD using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and then deployed on the Ropsten testnet to interract with the UI I built.

The UI is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [ant.design](https://ant.design/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## How to run

* Clone the repository
* Create a `.env` and fill it according to `.env.example`
* Run `yarn && yarn deploy` copy the contract address and add it to `web/.env`
* Run `cd web && yarn dev` open your browser on `http://localhost:3000` and voilÃ !
